        <h4>Programming Languages</h4>
        <p>
          The bulk of this repository consists of programming languages,
          and they are:
        </p>
        <ul class="progs">
          <li>
            Python, a dynamically typed high-level general purpose language,
            which emphasizes code readibility, as outlined in the
            <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/#the-zen-of-python">
              <em>Zen of Python</em>
            </a>;
          </li>
          <li>
            C and C++,
            high-level languages designed for low-level access to memory.
            C is imperative and procedural,while C++, a superset of C,
            supports object-oriented programming (OOP);
          </li>
          <li>
            Java, an object-oriented language,
            primarily defined by <i>(its verbosity, and)</i> the motto
            <em>Write Once, Run Anywhere</em>,
            as it was designed to run on any device with
            the Java Runtime Environment, which most devices nowadays do;
          </li>
          <li>
            HTML, a markup language for describing the structure of a website
            (this document is written in HTML, plus CSS for styling,
            otherwise it would just be a white page with black text);
          </li>
          <li>
            Rust, a systems language that, unlike C/C++,
            achieves memory safety with the use of borrow checking.
            It's considered one of the most loved programming languages;
          </li>
          <li>
            x86_64 Assembly, a low-level language that very few people write,
            but as it's one level above 0's and 1's,
            it achieves very high performance. x86_64 is for modern Intel
            and AMD CPUs, and has a Complex Instruction Set (CISC);
          </li>
          <li>
            Solidity, an object-oriented language used to implement
            smart contracts on blockchains, mainly the Ethereum network;
          </li>
          <li>
            COBOL, a self-documenting imperative language used in "dinosaur mainframes", like banking systems.
            If you know COBOL, you have a higher-than-average chance of getting hired if you apply to a company that has one of those old mainframes;
          </li>
          <li lang="pt">
              (<i>The following description is in Portuguese</i>)
              <br>
              Lua, uma linguagem de script criada na PUC-Rio para expandir aplicações de forma extensível.
              Possui uma sintaxe parecida com Python, tendo menos palavras-chave que ele, e seu código é capaz de ser integrado em códigos de outras linguagens, como o C.
          </li>
          <li>
              Julia, a programming language that has <q>the speed of C, the dynamism of Ruby, the practicality of Python,
              that can do statistics like R, and linear algebra like MATLAB, out of the box.</q>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Right now, these are the languages I plan on learning. However, this list might grow a bit, as I have considered adding Nim, Fortran and Elixir into the mix.
