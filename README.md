### Who Am I
My name is Dannyel, and I'm currently in my 4th semester of Computer Science. I'm fluent in English and Portuguese, and I'm learning French and Russian, plus some Occitan vocabulary every so often.  
I'm interested in statistics and data science, but my passion lies in 3D Modeling. Here's an example of one of my projects:<br><br>

Final renders are available on my [ArtStation](https://www.artstation.com/danfonr), but the projects themselves are available on [another repository (Modelos3D)](https://github.com/danfonr/Modelos3D).

### About the DanFonR Repository
The special repository contains code that isn't part of any project (such as a template for Turing Machines with 32 states, or a way to calculate the day of the week based on a given date).  
It is broken down by language.
